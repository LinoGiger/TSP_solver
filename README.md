Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver
=======================================

Introduction
------------
This project provides various algorithms and methods to solve the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
The implementation took place as part of a Project at **HSLU (Lucerne School of Information Technology)** to function as a visual tool for the Modul of Industrial Optimization.

Many Thanks go to **Reinhard BÃ¼rgy** who came up with the project.

API Key generation
------------------
To use the App, you'll need a Free OpenRouteService API Key. 

**Steps to generate one:**

1. Visit the [OpenRouteService Sign Up page](https://openrouteservice.org/sign-up/).
2. Create an account or sign in if you already have one.
3. Once logged in, navigate to the Dashboard --> "Tokens" section.
4. Here, you can create a new API token or manage existing ones.

Now you can paste it in the `API_KEY.txt` file

Existing TSP Solving Methods
-----------------------------
The project currently incorporates methods such as `TwoOpt`, `Permutation`, `FlowBased`, and `ConstraintProgramming`.


Adding a New TSP Solving Method
-------------------------------
1. **Define the New Method**: 
    - Create a new class for your method in `tsp_logic.py` and make sure it inherits from the interface TSPMethod.
    - Your class needs to have a `solve` method that accepts a cost matrix as input and returns the solution (tour) for the TSP. Make sure that in the end you return to the original position.
2. **Update the TSPMethodFactory**:
    - Modify the `TSPMethodFactory` class to handle the creation of an instance of your new method based on its name.
3. **GUI Integration**: 
    - To make your method available as an option on the dash website, add its name to the `dcc.Dropdown` list in `dash.py`. Ensure consistency with the name used in the Factory.

Contributing
------------
To contribute to this project, ensure that any new methods or changes are thoroughly tested and documented. Bugfixes and improvments as well as new Methods are welcome.

Running the App
-----------------
To run the app, run the `app.py` file after cloning the repository.

Specifying Locations
--------------------

If a location name overlaps with another, you can provide additional details to distinguish them. Use the format:

```
City Name, State Name, Country
```

This is similar to the format used in Google Maps.

![Example Route with Same Names](images/example_route_same_names.png "Example Route with Same Names")
![Example Route through USA (saved)](images/example_route_trough_USA.png "Example Route through USA (saved)")
